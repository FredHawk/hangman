# Hangman

A little hangman game I made to practice writing a game with javascript and the DOM.

Guess the word before the man gets hanged!


## Game mechanics
- Picks a random word out of the words in the predetermined array, can add or change as you wish in this.
- Checks the input in the input field so it is a single letter, not a non letter and not nothing.
- Displays how many wrong guesses you have left.
- Gives instructions on what you did wrong if you did something wrong.
- Can enter guesses using either button press or by pressing ENTER.
